# Automation ROI Calculator

A simple web-based calculator that helps teams determine whether automating a process is worth doing.

## Overview

This tool calculates the return on investment (ROI) for automation projects by comparing the costs of development and maintenance against the time and money saved by eliminating manual processes.

## Features

- Calculate development costs based on hourly rates and estimated hours
- Calculate maintenance costs over a specified timeframe
- Calculate time and cost savings from automating manual processes
- Determine the break-even point for automation projects
- Get a clear recommendation on whether to automate or keep processes manual

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
2. Input your project-specific values:
   - Developer hourly rate
   - Estimated development hours
   - Annual maintenance hours
   - Current manual process time (in minutes)
   - Process frequency (times per month)
   - Manual process hourly rate
   - Analysis timeframe (in months)
3. The calculator will automatically update with results

## Results Explanation

The calculator provides the following results:

- **Development Cost**: One-time cost to build the automation
- **Maintenance Cost**: Ongoing cost to maintain the automation over the specified timeframe
- **Total Automation Cost**: Sum of development and maintenance costs
- **Time Saved**: Total hours saved by automation over the timeframe
- **Manual Cost Saved**: Money saved by eliminating manual processes
- **Net Savings**: Manual cost saved minus total automation cost
- **Break-even Point**: Number of months until the automation pays for itself
- **Recommendation**: Clear advice on whether to automate or keep the process manual

## Installation

No installation required! Simply download the files and open `index.html` in your browser.
